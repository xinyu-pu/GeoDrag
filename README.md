## Disclaimer
This is a research project, NOT a commercial product. Users are granted the freedom to create images using this tool, but they are expected to comply with local laws and utilize it in a responsible manner. The developers do NOT assume any responsibility for potential misuse by users.

## News and Updates
* [Oct 10] Released the implementation code of GeoDrag.

## Installation
> **Recommended environment:** Linux system with an NVIDIA GPU.  
> The project has not been fully tested on other operating systems or hardware configurations.  
> <span style="color:#1E90FF;">*Running our method currently needs around 6 GB of GPU memory. We will continue to optimize memory efficiency.*</span>

To install the required libraries, simply run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate geodrag
```

Next, download the pretrained **Depth Anything V2** weights by running:
```bash
bash download.sh model
```

## Run GeoDrag
### Gradio demo
From the command line, run the following to launch the Gradio user interface:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

You can refer to [GIF above](https://github.com/Yujun-Shi/DragDiffusion/blob/main/release-doc/asset/github_video.gif) for a step-by-step demonstration of how to use the UI.

### CLI demo
To run GeoDrag directly from the command line, use:
```bash
python3 inference_drag.py \
    -c path/to/config \
    -i path/to/image \
    -m path/to/meta-data \
    -o path/to/output-dir
  
# example
# python3 inference_drag.py \
#     -c configs/base_configs.yaml \
#     -i datasets/DragBench/animals/JH_2023-09-14-1820-16/original_image.png \
#     -m datasets/DragBench/animals/JH_2023-09-14-1820-16/meta_data.pkl \
#     -o output

# -c: config file path
# -i: input image
# -m: metadata (drag points, mask, and prompt)
# -o: output directory
```

### DRAGBENCH demo
Download [DragBench](https://github.com/Yujun-Shi/DragDiffusion/releases/download/v0.1.1/DragBench.zip) into the folder "datasets" by running:
```bash
bash download.sh dragbench
```

To evaluate GeoDrag on the **DRAGBENCH** benchmark, run the following command:
```bash
python3 inference_dragbench.py \
    -c path/to/config \
    -b path/to/benchmark \
    -o path/to/output

# example
# python3 inference_dragbench.py \
#     -c configs/base_configs.yaml \
#     -b datasets/DragBench
#     -o outputs
```

## Quantitative evaluation
### Single-result evaluation
To compute quantitative evaluation metrics on a single result, run:
```bash
python3 -m evaluation single \
    -s '["MD", "IF", "DAI"]' \
    -i path/to/image \
    -m path/to/meta-data \
    -e path/to/edited-image 
  
# The `-s` argument specifies which scores to compute.
# You can choose any combination of the following:
#   MD  – Mean Distance
#   IF  – Image Fidelity
#   DAI – Dragging Accuracy Index
# For example:
#   -s '["MD"]'
#   -s '["MD", "IF"]'
#   -s '["MD", "IF", "DAI"]'
```

### DRAGBENCH evaluation
To directly compute quantitative results on the DRAGBENCH benchmark, run:
```bash
python3 -m evaluation benchmark \
    -b path/to/benchmark-results
```
Results will be summarized and printed in the terminal.
